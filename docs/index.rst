Welcome to PyNLPIR's documentation!
===================================

PyNLPIR is a Python wrapper for the
`NLPIR/ICTCLAS Chinese segmentation software <nlpir.org>`_.

NLPIR (Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval Sharing Platform)
provides Chinese word segmentation and lexical analysis. It's also known as
ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System).

NLPIR/ICTCLAS is freely available for non-commerical use. The NLPIR/ICTCLAS
binary files included in PyNLPIR run on 32-bit/64-bit Windows or GNU/Linux.

PyNLPIR's wrapper doesn't provide a one-to-one API with NLPIR/ICTCLAS. Instead,
a fairly typical Python API is wrapped around NLPIR/ICTCLAS's native API.
