Welcome to PyNLPIR's documentation!
===================================

PyNLPIR is a Python wrapper for the
`NLPIR/ICTCLAS Chinese segmentation software <nlpir.org>`_.

NLPIR (Natural Language Processing & Information Retrieval Sharing Platform)
provides Chinese word segmentation and lexical analysis. It's also known as
ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System).

NLPIR/ICTCLAS is freely available for non-commerical use. The NLPIR/ICTCLAS
binary files included in PyNLPIR run on 32-bit/64-bit Windows or GNU/Linux.

If this is your first time using PyNLPIR, check out :doc:`installation`. Then read
the :doc:`tutorial`.

If you want a more in-depth view of PyNLPIR, check out the :doc:`api`.
